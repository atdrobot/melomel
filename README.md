Melomel -- An External ActionScript Interface
=============================================

## Overview

Melomel is an API for accessing ActionScript objects in the Flash virtual
machine through external languages. This is especially useful for
integrating Flash into a full stack functional testing solution such
as [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) or [RSpec](http://rspec.info).

Please visit the [http://melomel.info](http://melomel.info) for full
documentation.
